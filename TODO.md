# Dionysus TODO List

### Priority's
- [ ] Task: Content Creator Reward System Based on how many subs/videos/viwers/etc someone has (Need OAuth For This Sadly :/)
- [ ] Task: Use Pal Pal's/Stripe's API to create an donate reward system (may not be possible due to identifying)
- [ ] Create a web site for oauth with listed tasks and dashboard for configuring, plus documentation, the website will be called dionysus.nyx.io
- [ ] Update system on different problems the bot is currently experiencing
- [ ] Server voting reward system
- [ ] Add roles based on someone's creation or server join date


### Backburner
- [ ] Improve reminder system by using an database and loop through in case the bot goes down
- [ ] Add a command to quickly update to an new counting number


### In Progress
- [-] Update comments in code
- [-] Task system where bot performs a automated action every set day/week/month I.E. purge users from the last 7 days every Monday (Support for conditions?)

### Completed
